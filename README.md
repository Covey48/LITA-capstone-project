## PROJECT TITLE: SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS FOR A RETAIL SORE
---

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
---
This project aims to analyze the sales performance of a retail store. I seek to explore the sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional
performance, and monthly sales trends.

### DATA SOURCES
---
The source of this data was generated by the facilitators of the LITA PROGRAM for the capstone project

### TOOLS USED
---
- SQL Structured Query Language for data entry, data querying and data cleaning 
- Microsoft Excel for data analysis, data validation and Data visualization 
- GitHub for Portfolio building
- Microsoft word for report writing 

### 	DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
---
In the Initial phase of Data cleaning and preparation, I performed the following actions;
1.  Data loading and inspection
2.  Handling missing variables
3.  Data cleaning and formatting
4. Removing duplicates
5. Data importation into SQL

###  	EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
---
This involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- total sales by product, region, and month.
- the highest-selling product by total sales value.
- the  total revenue per product.
- the monthly sales totals for the current year.
- the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
- the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
- identify products with no sales in the last quarter.

###  DATA ANALYSIS
---
This is where I inputed some basic line of functions and queries like;

~~~
            MS EXCEL
    =AVERAGEIF(D2:D50001,D2,H2:H50001)
 =SUMIF(C2:C50001,C2,H2:H50001)
~~~

~~~
        SQL

select * from [dbo].[LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT 11]

SELECT Product, SUM (SalesPrice) AS TOTALSALES FROM [dbo].[LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT 11]
GROUP BY Product

SELECT Region, COUNT (SalesPrice) AS NoOfSalesTransactions FROM [dbo].[LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT 11]
GROUP BY Region

SELECT Product, MAX (SalesPrice) AS HighestSellingProduct FROM [dbo].[LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT 11]
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY 2 DESC

SELECT OrderDate FROM [dbo].[LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT 11]
WHERE YEAR (OrderDate) in (2024) 

SELECT Month(OrderDate) AS Month, SUM(SalesPrice) AS MonthlySalesTotal
FROM [dbo].[LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT 11] WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2024
GROUP BY Month(OrderDate)
ORDER BY Month

SELECT Top (5) Customer_Id,
 SUM(SalesPrice) AS TotalPurchaseAmount FROM [dbo].[LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT 11]
GROUP BY Customer_Id
ORDER BY 2 Desc

SELECT Region, SUM(SalesPrice) AS RegionTotalSales,
FORMAT(ROUND((SUM(SalesPrice) / CAST((SELECT SUM(SalesPrice) FROM [dbo].[LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT 11]) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) * 100), 1), '0.#') 
AS PercentageOfTotalSales
FROM [dbo].[LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT 11]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY 3 DESC

SELECT Product FROM [dbo].[LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT 11]
GROUP BY Product
HAVING SUM(CASE 
WHEN OrderDate BETWEEN '2024-06-01' AND '2024-08-31' 
THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
~~~

### DATA VISUALIZATION
------------
I used pivot tables and charts to summarize total sales by product, region, and month
